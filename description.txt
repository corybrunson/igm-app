<p>Each year, as part of its <a href="http://www.igmchicago.org/">Initiative on Global Markets</a>, the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago sends a biweekly series of survey questions to a panel of 60 economists, pooled from seven top departments at U.S. universities and selected for their ideological diversity.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel">The results</a> have been cited in <a href="http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/57999/">academic</a> <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2520776">research</a> and in <a href="http://freakonomics.com/2012/07/25/the-secret-consensus-among-economists/">popular/social media</a>, often to demonstrate the counterintuitive level of consensus among economists, who are notorious for their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0o0In_4R1l4">factionalized schools of thought</a>. However, as emphasized in <a href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/aea/aer/2013/00000103/00000003/art00109">a paper</a> (<a href="http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/luigi.zingales/papers/research/Economic-Experts-vs-Average-Americans.pdf">PDF preprint</a>) coauthored by one of the survey's initiators, Luigi Zingales, the show of consensus on many of the IGM's jargon-laden questions does not necessarily translate into broad agreement on issues of public interest and policy. Moreover, the questions posed by IGM are no more selected for representativeness than the panelists.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the distribution of specific questions and general topics across the landscape of agreement reveals some unexpected structure. This app uses two methods to situate the questions according to the distribution of the panelists' responses. (Each is described in its own tab.) Some suggestions for exploration: brush over the questions with the most uncertainty, or observe the overall effects of weighting strong (dis)agreement and confidence more heavily, or type "gold" into the topic filter. Full <code>R</code> code to scrape the IGM website, construct the responses dataset, and build this <a href="http://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny App</a> is on <a href="https://github.com/corybrunson/igm.chicago">GitHub</a>, along with some miscellaneous other, often incomplete, scripts. For an engaging, dual take on how the panelists are distributed, take a look at Chris Said's <a href="http://whichfamouseconomistareyoumostsimilarto.com/">Which Famous Economist</a> website.</p>
