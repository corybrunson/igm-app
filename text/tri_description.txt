<p>This plot treats the three basic responses available to the panelists—agreement, disagreement, and uncertainty—as distinct dimensions in which each panelist tugs the aggregate opinion: The more responses of each type a question receives, the closer it is located to that corner of the plot. Only the proportional spread of a question's responses, not their raw tallies, determines its location.</p>

<p>There are noticeable areas of high and low density: A great many questions receive near-unanimous responses, while none even approach universal uncertainty. There is also a positive relationship between the the polarization of a question—how vertically centered it is—and the proportion of uncertain responses it receives. The point cloud is symmetric in shape, if not in density, about the triangle's horizontal bisector. Collapsing this symmetry should preserve much of its essential structure; the <strong>Consensus Plot</strong> illustrates one way to do this.</p>
