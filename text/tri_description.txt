<p>This plot treats agreement, disagreement, and uncertainty as distinct dimensions of the space in which the survey responses are situated. Each panelist tugs the coordinates of the aggregate opinion in the direction of their response, so that, the more responses of each type a question receives, the closer it is located to that corner of the plot. If strong (dis)agreement and confidence are positively weighted, then responses with greater weight tug each point farther in their direction. The proportional spread of a question's responses, not its raw tallies, determines its location.</p>

<p>There are noticeable areas of high and low density: A great many questions receive near-unanimous responses (likely due to the selective wording of the questions), while none even approach universal uncertainty. There is also a positive relationship between the the polarization of a question—how vertically centered it is—and the proportion of uncertain responses it receives. The region occupied by the points has mirror symmetry (in shape, not density) about the horizontal bisector, and collapsing this symmetry would allow us to examine the panelists' agreement <em>with each other</em> without reference to their agreement <em>with the wording of each statement</em>. The <strong>Consensus Plot</strong> illustrates one way to do this.</p>
