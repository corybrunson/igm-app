<p>Here we consider more closely the positive relationship between polarization and uncertainty. The horizontal axis records the proportion of uncertain responses to each question, while the vertical axis records a measure of the pairwise agreement <em>among those respondents who were not uncertain</em>.</p>

<p>Higher uncertainty is less frequent for all levels of consensus, though the differential is greatest among cases of strong consensus. In the other direction, the range of consensus is consistent across most levels of uncertainty; only when the proportion of uncertain panelists falls below 15% is near-unanimity guaranteed among the remaining panelists. The plot also reveals an apparent upper limit on the proportion of uncertain panelists, around 70%. This could be a product of the choice of questions, or it could reflect the willingness of panelists to express (dis)agreement even with evidentially undecidable statements. To distinguish the questions that received near-unanimous agreement from those that received near-unanimous disagreement, see the <strong>Agreement Plot</strong>.</p>
