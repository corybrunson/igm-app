<p>The two scatterplots can be intuitively transformed into each other. For the transformation, imagine folding the Agreement Plot along its horizontal bisector, resulting in a right triangle, then widening the rightward (acute) corner until it forms a rectangle. This approximates the consensus–uncertainty plot. Reciprocally, the Consensus Plot can be "squished" on its right side and "unfolded" to recover the Agreement Plot.</p>

<p>The plots reflect different interpretations of the response data. On the assumption that the panelists' responses would reverse if each question statement were recast as its negative, it makes sense to collapse the agreement and disagreement responses into a single measure of "agreement with the majority opinion", which is what the consensus statistic is designed to do. The Consensus Plot interprets uncertainty as a binary alternative to (dis)agreement, which may be reasonable or not, depending on how the panelists process their answers. If we instead view the three response options as unordered, then we get the three-way symmetry of the Agreement Plot.</p>

<p>From the Agreement Plot, it is immediately clear that the data have one primary and one secondary dimension. The primary dimension reflects the extent of agreement to the question statement: it traces an arc from universal agreement at one vertex, through maximum dissensus at the centroid, to universal disagreement at an adjacent vertex. The secondary dimension reflects the extent of uncertainty, <em>controlling for</em> the extent of agreement: a question is situated rightward of the arc if more panelists than usual express uncertainty, given the level of agreement among those who don't, and leftward if fewer panelists than usual express uncertainty. While both dimensions are visible in the more classical Consensus Plot, the primacy of the agreement–disagreement arc is obscured, and only a messy correlation between uncertainty and dissensus comes through.</p>
