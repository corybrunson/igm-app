<p>The plots reflect different interpretations of the response data. On the assumption that the panelists' responses would reverse if each question statement were recast as its negative, it makes sense to collapse the agreement and disagreement responses into a single measure of "agreement with the majority opinion", which is what the consensus statistic is designed to do. The <strong>Consensus Plot</strong> interprets uncertainty as a binary alternative to (dis)agreement, which may be reasonable or not, depending on how the panelists process their answers. If we instead view the three response options as unordered, then we get the three-way symmetry of the <strong>Agreement Plot</strong>.</p>

<p>From the Agreement Plot, it appears that the data have one primary and one secondary dimension. The primary dimension reflects the extent of agreement to the question statement: it traces an arc from universal agreement at one vertex, through maximum dissensus near the centroid, to universal disagreement at an adjacent vertex. The secondary dimension reflects the extent of uncertainty, <em>controlling for</em> the extent of agreement: a question is situated rightward of the arc if more panelists than usual express uncertainty, given the level of agreement among those who don't, and leftward if fewer panelists than usual express uncertainty. While both dimensions are visible in the Consensus Plot, the primacy of the agreementâ€“disagreement arc is obscured, and only a weak, heteroscedastic relationship between uncertainty and dissensus comes through. (Note: Homoscedasticity may be obtained by reversing the predictor and response roles of the variables, i.e. by reading the scatterplot <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/09/who-invented-supply-and-demand.html">like an economist</a>. It may be psychologically reasonable to consider the extent of agreement as a predictor of, rather than a response to, the extent of uncertainty, though the panelists are not privy to each other's responses before they submit them.)</p>
