<p>Each semester, as part of its <a href="http://www.igmchicago.org/">Initiative on Global Markets</a>, the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago sends a biweekly series of survey questions to a panel of 50 economists.</p>

<p>The panelists are pooled from seven top departments at U.S. universities and selected for their ideological diversity. Each survey may contain up to three questions (A, B, C), relating to economics and public policy, in the form of factual and empirical, though often value-laden and publicly controversial, statements. Each panelist is asked to opine on each statement, with respect to the available relevant evidence, on a 5-point Likert scale from Strong Disagreement, through Uncertainty, to Strong Agreement. If an economist feels unqualified to evaluate the evidence, they respond with no opinion. The cumulative survey results constitute the <strong>Data</strong>.</p>

<p>While the survey interprets a panelist's (dis)agreement and confidence analogously to an estimator and its standard error, a correlation emerges between the two. If strength and confidence are to be treated as independent, this correlation must be corrected for; the <strong>Confidence Plot</strong> suggests one solution.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel">The results</a> convey the level of consensus or dissensus among professional economists. They have been cited in <a href="http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/57999/">academic</a> <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2520776">research</a> and in <a href="http://freakonomics.com/2012/07/25/the-secret-consensus-among-economists/">popular/social media</a>, often to demonstrate a counterintuitive unanimity of opinion in a discipline notorious for its <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w6151">entrenched disagreements over policy</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0o0In_4R1l4">factionalized schools of thought</a>. However, as emphasized in <a href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/aea/aer/2013/00000103/00000003/art00109">a paper</a> (<a href="http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/luigi.zingales/papers/research/Economic-Experts-vs-Average-Americans.pdf">PDF preprint</a>) coauthored by Luigi Zingales, one of the survey's initiators, consensus on one of the IGM's technically-worded questions may not translate into broad agreement on practical questions of public interest and policy. Moreover, the questions posed by IGM may be no more selected for representativeness than the panelists. Nevertheless, the distribution of specific questions and general topics across the landscape of agreement reveals some definite structure, explored in the <strong>Agreement Plot</strong> and the <strong>Consensus Plot</strong>.</p>
