<p>Each semester, as part of its <a href="http://www.igmchicago.org/">Initiative on Global Markets</a>, the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago sends a biweekly series of survey questions to a panel of 60 economists.</p>

<p>The panelists are pooled from seven top departments at U.S. universities and selected for their ideological diversity. Each survey may contain up to three questions (A, B, C), relating to economics and public policy, in the form of factual and empirical, though often value-laden and publicly controversial, statements. Each panelist is asked to opine on each statement, with respect to the available relevant evidence, with (strong) agreement, (strong) disagreement, or uncertainty. If an economist feels unqualified to evaluate the evidence, they respond with no opinion.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel">The results</a> convey the level of consensus or dissensus among professional economists. They have been cited in <a href="http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/57999/">academic</a> <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2520776">research</a> and in <a href="http://freakonomics.com/2012/07/25/the-secret-consensus-among-economists/">popular/social media</a>, often to demonstrate a counterintuitive unanimity of opinion in a discipline notorious for its <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w6151">entrenched disagreements over policy</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0o0In_4R1l4">factionalized schools of thought</a>. However, as emphasized in <a href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/aea/aer/2013/00000103/00000003/art00109">a paper</a> (<a href="http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/luigi.zingales/papers/research/Economic-Experts-vs-Average-Americans.pdf">PDF preprint</a>) coauthored by Luigi Zingales, one of the survey's initiators, consensus on one of the IGM's technically-worded questions may not translate into broad agreement on practical questions of public interest and policy. Moreover, the questions posed by IGM may be no more selected for representativeness than the panelists. Nevertheless, the distribution of specific questions and general topics across the landscape of agreement reveals some definite structure, explored in the <strong>Agreement Plot</strong> and the <strong>Consensus Plot</strong>.</p>

<p>Below are the topics and full statements for each question. For the full listing and distribution of the panelists' responses, click the date field. (In a future version i'll let the user toggle an additional field of response counts.)
