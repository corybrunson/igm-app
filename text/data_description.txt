(For another nifty app, with a (dual) focus on the panelists rather than the questions, see Chris Said's <a href="http://whichfamouseconomistareyoumostsimilarto.com/">Which Famous Economist</a> website.)</p>

<p>The three <strong>Plots</strong> explore these data with different questions in mind.</p>
